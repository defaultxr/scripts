# mpls - list tracks in mpd's current playlist.
# includes the position in the playlist by default (unlike mpc)
# with one argument, only shows the current track and 10 before and after it.
# also shows an indicator next to the current track.

# usage:
# mpls [context-only]

# examples:
# mpls - lists the whole playlist
# mpls c - shows the current song and the ones near it.

# configuration:

# text to show in front of the current track
set prepend 'â–¶ '

# code:

set mpc (mpc --format='%position% - ')
