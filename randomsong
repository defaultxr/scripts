# randomsong - get a list of N random songs from your music directory.
# this caches a list of songs to a file so it only has to be generated once.
# it's recommended that the list be saved in /tmp so it will be regenerated once per boot (in case you get new songs)

# usage:
# randomsong [number]

# examples:
# randomsong - get one random song from your library
# randomsong 5 - get five random songs.

# configuration:

# your music directory
DIRECTORY='/media/music/'

# where to save the list of songs.
CACHE='/tmp/songlist.txt'

# code:

num="$1"

if [[ -z $num ]]; then
    num=1
fi

makesonglist() { # make songlist.txt
    find "$DIRECTORY" -iname '*.mp3' -or -iname '*.flac' -or -iname '*.m4a' -or -iname '*.ogg' >"$CACHE" 2>/dev/null
}

rsong() {
    if [[ -e "$CACHE" ]]; then
        sort -R "$CACHE" | head -$num
