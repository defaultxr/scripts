# scripts
Various small scripts I've written or found.

The sources of these scripts contain usage information and examples. Some of the scripts also have configuration options that you may need or want to change.

They're written in a variety of languages, but maybe I'd make bash versions of them at some point (even though Bash sucks).

More may be added soon.

* `a2v` (bash) - "audio to video". generate a video from a sound file and an image. useful, for example, if you want to upload a track to youtube.
* `filter` (perl6) - filter a list of filenames (stdin separated by newlines), outputting only those of a specified type.
* `mpls` (fish) - list tracks in mpd's current playlist, also showing an indicator next to the current track.
* `p` (fish) - "play". play something with mpv, joining its twitch chat via irc (weechat) if it's a twitch stream.
* `randomsong` (sh) - get a list of N random songs from your music directory.
* `v` (fish) - view images with sxiv. passes the rest of the images in the directory to sxiv as well. you can also specify a directory instead.
* `vol` (fish) - change alsa volume conveniently and intuitively.
